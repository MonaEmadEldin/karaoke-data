I was a monkey dancing in the trees
Out where the jungle used to be
Before the lumber company
Took my home away from me
Save me, save me
Speaking for those who cannot speak
Save me
It takes a thousand years to make
What can be wiped out in a day
Bulldozers plowing through the rain
Another forest washed away


Oh can you take of her
Oh maybe you can spare her
Several moments of your consideration
Leading up to the final destination
Oh the earth is calling out,
I wanna learn what it's all about,
But everything I read global warming going green
I don't know what all this means but it seems to be saying
Wake up America we're all in this together
It's our home so let's take care of it
You know that you want to
You know that you got to wake up America
Tomorrow becomes a new day and everything you do
Matters yeah everything you do matters in some way


[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forgetwooooo oooooh[Pitbull]
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
This biggity boy's a diggity dog
I have them like Miley Cyrus
Clothes off t**ng with my
Bras and thongs, timber
Face down, booty up, timber
That's the way we like the war, timber
I'm slicker than an oil spill
She say she won't, but I bet she will, timberSwing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down
Swing your partner round and round
End of the night, it's going down
One more shot, another round
End of the night, it's going down[Ke$ha]
It's going down, I'm yelling timber
You better move, you better dance
Let's make a night, you won't remember
I'll be the one, you won't forgetIt's going down (It's going down)
I'm yelling timber
You better move (You better move)

Let's make a night
You won't remember
I'll be the one
You won't forget (You won't forget)ooooh[Pitbull]
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane
Nah, it's just me, ain't a damn thing changed
Live in hotels, swing on plane
Blessed to say, money ain't a thing
Club jumping like Lebron, now, Voli


Man thinks 'cause he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don't change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon
Now, there's a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he's bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars
Now, there's a woman on my block,
She just sit there facin' the hill
She say who gonna take away his license to kill?


We set sailing
Floating down the love canal
We set sailing
Drifting down the love canal
We seem strange
Our bodies are breaking down
We are breeding
Our children look like monsters
We are breeding
Not to children but to monsters
We feel pain
Poison is killing our every cells
We are bitter
Poison is killing our very cells
We are dying
Our common grave is the love canal
We are dying
Our common grave is the love canal


I wanna walk up the side of a mountain
I wanna walk down the other side of the mountain
I wanna swim in the river and lie in the sun
I wanna try to be nice to everyone
(I wanna walk up the side of a mountain
I wanna walk down the other side of the mountain
I wanna swim in the river and lie in the sun
I wanna try to be nice to everyone)


Did you think that your feet had been bound
By what gravity brings to the ground?
Did you feel you were tricked
By the future you picked?
Well, come on down
All these rules don't apply
When you're high in the sky
So come on down
Come on down
We're coming down to the ground
There's no better place to go
We've got snow up on the mountains
We've got rivers down below
We're coming down to the ground
To hear the birds sing in the trees
And the land will be looked after
We send the seeds out in the breeze
Did you think you'd escaped from routine
By changing the script and the scene?
Despite all you made of it
You're always afraid of the change
You've got a lot on your chest
Well, you can come as my guest
So come on down
Come on down


The rains have come early, they say
We're all gonna wash away
Well, that's all right with me
If heaven's torrent can wash clean
The arrogance that lies unseen
In the damage done since we have gone
Where we ought not to be
Goodbye to a river
Goodbye to a river
So long
Lakes and levees, dams and locks
They put that river in a box
It was running wild
And men must have control
We live our lives in starts and fits
We lose our wonder bit by bit
We condescend and in the end
We lose our very souls
Goodbye to a river
Goodbye to a river
So long


There's a man workin' in a field
See's the rain and it's burning
He's saying this can't be real
As he sees the color of the fields turning
Far away the men too busy getting rich to care
Close their eyes and let it all out into the air
Hoping nobody else would care
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the world around you
There's a man working on a boat
Pulling lines from the water
Just trying to stay afloat
Filling the nets is getting harder
Far away they bend the rules so secretly
Close their eyes and let it all out into the sea
Hoping nobody else would see
Look out any window
Look out any open door
Look out any window
See what's going on in the air around you


What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things that you said
We were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said were yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores
Aah, ooh
What have we done to the world
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son
What about flowering fields
Is there a time
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying earth, these weeping shores
Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far
Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh
Aah, ooh


There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make it a better place
For you and for me
If you want to know why
There's love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares of joyful giving
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear of dread
We stop existing and start living
The it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me


Three it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number
Because two times three is six
And three times six is eighteen
And the eighteenth letter in the alphabet is r
We've got three r's we're going to talk about today
We've got to learn to
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle
If you're going to the market to buy some juice
You've got to bring your own bags and you learn to reduce your waste
And if your brother or your sister's got some cool clothes
You could try them on before you buy some more of those
Reuse, we've got to learn to reuse
And if the first two r's don't work out
And if you've got to make some trash
Don't throw it out
Recycle, we've got to learn to recycle,
We've got to learn to
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Reduce, reuse, recycle
Because three it's a magic number
Yes it is, it's a magic number
Three, three, three
Three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, twenty one, twenty four, twenty seven, thirty, thirty three, thirty six
Thirty three, thirty, twenty seven, twenty four, twenty one, eighteen, fifteen, twelve, nine, six
Three, is the magic number


Travelin' down that coal town road. Listenin' to my rubber tires whine.
Goodbye to Buckeye and white Sycamore. I'm leavin' you behind.
I've been coal miner all of my life. Layin' down track in the hole.
Gotta back like an ironwood, bit by the wind. Blood veins blue as the coal. Blood veins blue as the coal.
Somebody said, "That's a strange tattoo you have on the side of your head"
I said, "That's the blueprint left by the coal. A little more and I'd been dead
Well, I love the rumble and I love the dark. I love the cool of the slade
And it's on down the new road, lookin' for a job. This travelin' nook in my head"
I stood for the union and walked in the line and fought against the company
I stood for the U. M. W. of A. Now, who's gonna stand for me?
I've got no house and I got no job, just got a worried soul
And a blue tattoo on the side of my head left by the number nine coal. Left by the number nine coal
Someday when I'm dead and gone to heaven, the land of my dreams
I won't have to worry on losin' my job, on bad times and big machines
I ain't gonna pay my money away on dues or hospital plans
I'm gonna pick coal where the blue heavens roll and sing with the angel band


Out in the country,
Far from all the soot and noise of the city,
There's a village green.
It's been a long time
Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple
Down by the village green.
Twas there I met a girl called daisy
And kissed her by the old oak tree.
Although I loved my daisy, I saw fame,
And so I left the village green.
I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.
And now all the houses
Are rare antiquities.
American tourists flock to see the village green.
They snap their photographs and say "gawd darn it,
Isn't it a pretty scene?"
And daisy's married tom the grocer boy,
And now he owns a grocery.
I miss the village green,
And all the simple people.
I miss the village green,
The church, the clock, the steeple.
I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school.
And I will return there,
And I'll and daisy,
And we'll sip tea, laugh,
And talk about the village green.
We will laugh and talk about the village green.


Air
I was breathing it
It's staring yet
Fixed and frozen
I dare
To go off the air
Right there
Mare
I was believing it
Unessential yet
Forgotten
There
I'll pull my luck out of
Thin air
Wherever I go
Supernova
Let me know
Wherever I go
That I'll grow
I'll seize
The opportunity
A fateful hour
To take to my heels
A fee
No fear no doubt
All of a heap


When will we know love?
When will we listen to heaven above?
And how will we return?
Someone said that we've been tempting fate
But I believe this song just wouldn't come if it's too late.
When will we see a light upon the ocean.
Shining like a star
That leads us ever onward
There's a new world waiting
When will we see rebirth
This island Earth
Maybe our moment is gone
Maybe we've stood and watched
A moment too long
So why do I believe?
Someone said
That the truth's too much to take
But tell me how we can face it
If we only want to look the other way
When will we see a light upon the ocean.
Shining like a star
That leads us ever onward
There's a new world waiting
When will we see rebirth
This island Earth


I am done with great things and big things,
Great Institutions and big success
And I am for those tiny invisible, molecular moral forces
That work from individual to individual,
Through the crannies of the world, like so many grouplets,
Or like the capillary oozing of water,
Yet which, if you give them time,
They'll rend the hardest monuments of man's pride.
The paradox of our time in history
Is that we have taller buildings, but shorter tempers,
We have wider freeways with narrower viewpoints.
We spend more, but we have less;
We buy more, but we enjoy it less.
We have bigger houses and smaller families;
More conveniences and less time;
We have more degrees but less depth;
More knowledge, but less judgement;
More experts, but more problems;
More medicine, but less wellness.
Disarmament with mutual honour and confidence,
Is a continuing imperative.
Together we must learn how to compose differences,
Not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose.
Another war could utterly destroy this civilisation,
Which has been so slowly and
Painfully building over thousands of years.
We must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
Whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.


Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride that never stops
Hey Mister Bee the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you'll survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey Miss Dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am I
A dog looked at me and said, Ziggy why can't we trust man
Puss and me get together, so, why can't you all just understand
An old tree stood there silently listening to every word we said
As a tear fell he cried what type of creature is man
I said hey Mister Tree the world change but you remain the same
And I wonder how you survive with the environment going down the drain
Hey Miss Butterfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am I
You must be wondering what type of creature am I
Everybody's worried about time
But I just keep that shit off my mind
People living on twenty four hour clocks
But we're on a ride, yes we're on a ride, we're on a ride that never stops
Hey Mister Bee the world change but you remain the same
And I hope you'll survive while the environment is going down the drain
Hey Miss Dragonfly I see you look at me with your beautiful eyes
You must be wondering what type of creature am I
You must be wondering what type of creature is man


People talkin 'bout solutions, over and over
'Bout how we need a revolution, over and over
I was talking 'bout ecology, over and over
'Bout how we'll be saved by technology, over and over
While the cat next door spends all his time
Trying to think up new antisocial crimes
I said no, I said hang on a minute now
I set let me outta here
I said no, no, no
People talking revolution, over and over
About a mass execution, over and over
Well I was working in a factory, over and over
Just trying to make it satisfactory, over and over
But all these inclinations toward manic frustration
I want my vaccination against castration
Vietnam, what a sexy war
Uncle Sam's a pimp, wants us to be whores,
I said no, I said I can't take much more of this
You better let me outta here
I said no, no, no
Oh you see I need a release for my frustration
Oh don't you see I can't hold my aggravation
Oh...no, no, no, no
I see people dyin', over and over
Why don't I sit around crying, over and over
I see people taking, over and over
Why don't I sit around waiting, over and over
The cop on the street wants us down on our knees
The president says we've got to have peace
The other cat says we need our liberation
The hippies telling us we're in the love generation
I said whoa, I said hang on a minute now
This can't go on much longer
I said whoa, whoa, whoa
Over and over, over and over
Over and over, over and over


Endangered species, caged in fright
Shot in cold blood, no chance to fight
The stage is set, now pay the price
And ego boost, don't think twice
Technology, the battle's unfair,
You pull the hammer without a care
Squeeze the trigger that makes you Man,
Pseudo-safari, the hunt is canned
The hunt is canned
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction
Tell the truth, you wouldn't dare
The skin and trophy, oh so rare
Silence speaks louder than words
Ignore the guilt and take your turn
'Liars' anagram is lairs
Man you were never even there
Killed a few feet from the cages
Point blank, you're so courageous
So courageous
All are gone, all but one
No contest, nowhere to run
No more left, only one
This is it, this is the countdown to extinction


I'm a snow plough
I must now plough on
I'm a snow plough
I'm a settler's son
I'm a storm cloud
Rain myself all over the place
I'm a storm cloud
Wipe that smile right off your face
There must be one place left in the world
Where the mountains meet the sea
There must be one place left in the world
Where the water's real and clean
I'm a landslide
I'm a downhill run
I'm a landslide
Open season's just begun
There must be one place left in the world
Where the skin says it can breathe
There's gotta be one place left in the world
It's a solitude of distance and relief
There's gotta be one place left in the world
I'm a snow plough
There has to be one place left in the world
I'm a snow plough
One place
One place left in the world
I'm a short fuser
I'm a slow bluesr
I'm a landslide hummin I'm a downhill runnin
There must be one place left in this world
Where we can be
