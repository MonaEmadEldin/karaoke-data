We need to wake up
We need to wise up
We need to open our eyes
And do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

We’re on a planet that has a problem
We’ve got to solve it, get involved
And do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

Make it greener
Make it cleaner
Make it last
make it fast
and do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

No point in waiting
Or hesitating
We must get wise, take no more lies
And do it now
We need to build a better future
And we need to start right now

The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?

Dear Future Generations,
I speak for the rest of us
I speak for the rest of us when I say
Sorry we left you with our mess of a planet
Sorry that we were too caught up in our own doings
Sorry we listened to people who made excuses
excuses to do nothing
We just didn't realize how special the earth was
We didn't know what we had until it was gone

You know what is the Amazon Desert
Once there was the Amazon Rain Forest
Oh, you don't know much about trees, do you?
Well let me tell you that trees are amazing
We breathe the air the trees are creating 
Trees clean up our pollution
trees that store and purify water,
We burned down our trees.

most of us today don't care about tomorrow
we put profit above people
Greed over need
the rule of gold above the golden rule
We used nature as a credit card with no spending limit
We had the nerve to call this destruction "Progress"

climate change is a threat
rising sea levels flood our homes
glaciers are melting away
do you love the smell of fossil fuels
It can be denied, not avoided
Our footprints became a sinkhole and not a garden
ice is melting in the arctic
I'm sorry we didn't find another planet to move to
This is a future I cannot accept
We are the root, we are the foundation, this generation
It is up to us to take care of this planet
It is our only home, we must globally warm our hearts
Change the climate of our souls
Realize that we are not apart from nature
We are a part of nature
To betray nature is to betray us
whatever you're fighting for:
If we don't all work together to save the environment We will be equally extinct

I believe it's not too late
Together we can change the world
Lay the puzzle pieces out find out what it's all about

Can't do it by myself so I'm asking for your help
Sail past where it's been charted
Roll your sleeves up
let's get started

With our hands and with our hearts We can dare to make a start
What if we spoke with one voice, Knowing that we have a choice?

Change your mind and change your life
Set aside the fear and strife
When we open up our eyes then we start to realize
together we can change the world

Yeah, it's time to work, live life sustainable
I feel like that's a goal that's attainable
Recycling can and bottles and glass

I've been called upon to save the planet
The only problem is I can't do it singled-handed
Unplug your xbox, all electronics
Cuz it uses energy even when you're not on it

Don't throw away that bottle, recycle
don't drive around town, please bicycle
Look good, save the environment and feel great

We gotta reduce, find a new use
the planet is already taking too much abuse
It's time to go green
live environmental
clean up the earth 
treat our planet more gentle
I gotta live life more eco-friendly
So choose to walk instead of driving your bentley

Captain Planet much like a hero
I can take your carbon footprint down to zero
I encourage you to all buy local
Voice concern, spread the message and be vocal

This is an open letter from you and me together
Tomorrow's in our hands now
Find the words that matter, say them out loud
make it better somehow
Looking down from up on the moon it's a tiny blue marble
Who'd have thought the ground we stand on could be so fragile?

This is a love song to the earth
You're no ordinary world
A diamond in the universe
Heaven's poetry to us
Keep it safe
'Cause it's our world
it's our world

It's not about possessions, money or religion
How many years we might live
When the only real question that matters is still 
A matter of perspective

See mama earth is in a crazy mess 
It's time for us to do our best
From deep sea straight up to everest
She under crazy stress unless you wanna be motherless
Clean heart, green heart is the way I stress
Speediness and too much greediness
Six billion people all want plentiness
Some people think this is harmless
But if we continue there'll only be emptiness

The Earth is mother, she will take care of us
The Sky is our Father, we will take care of him
The Sea is our Sister, we will take care of her
The Forest is our Brother, we will take care of him

Put out the fire
Our house is on fire

We love you, we hear you
We commit to change our ways
Not later, but sooner
Right now, for your future

Youth can’t wait
Planet can’t wait

For our children 
For our children and their children

For songbirds, for clean air
For the oceans and the bays

Melting glaciers
Rising seas
Bleaching coral

Shrinking shorelines
Sinking islands
Growing drylands

Let bees live
let trees grow
Let the snow fall where it may

We're in it together forever and ever
Saving our water land and air
This is our planet to share
We need clean air around us all
Land to walk on and Waterfalls
But the world is changing day by day
Listen to what we say
One by one
We can spread the news on out how to stop
Pollution blues
Together were reaching out to you
To help us save the Earth
Earth were in it together
Forever and ever
Saving our water land and air
This is our planet to share
Imagine our world
Clean and litter free
From the ocean to the sky
Join our hands
Share the vision we can see
Let's begin by taking pride taking pride
Earth
We're in it together forever and ever
Saving our water land and air
This is our planet to share
Earth
We're in it together forever and ever
Saving our water land and air
This is our planet to share
Together we can show we care

Is it really over?
The echoes just seem to get longer
How did we get here?
There's so much love in us

And all I have left is my faith that I can change
I can't watch this burn
I can't watch this burn to the ground
You'd have thought we'd learned
You'd have thought we'd learned by now

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world say it's now or never
'Cause it's not too late
If we change our ways
And connect the dots to our problems

I can hear the whole world sing we're in this together
We're in this together

Picking up the pieces
I listen out for beating hearts
Now it's time for healing
The sun will rise but this time it's so bright

And all I have left is my faith that we could change
'Cause I can't watch us lose
I can't watch us lose what we've found

You'd have thought we'd learned
You'd have thought we'd learned by now

I can hear the whole world singing together
I can hear the whole world say it's now or never
'Cause it's not too late
If we change our ways
We're in this together

So you cut all the tall trees down
you poisoned the sky and the sea
You've taken what's good from the ground
But you've left precious little for me
You remember the flood and the fall
we remember the light on the hill
There should be enough for us all, but the dollar is driving us still
River runs red, black rain falls, dust in my hand
River runs red, black rain falls, on my bleeding land

Woke up this morning to the news
The big men were fighting over all we’ve got to lose
But something there was missing from their talk
something that could change us all

Oh no, there it grows
It’s building up to take over our world
But who is brave, and knows the road, that leads us all to where we need to go
Away from the Shadows
It’s hard to fight for something you can’t see
But we’re so close now, can’t you feel its ferocity
Look at the families huddled in distress
Look at the houses lost in the mess
Look at the waves crashing as we run
Look at the burning embers of the sun
Look at the tears on the mother’s face, her child swept away to another place
Some may say we can have it all but if we live like this then watch us fall

Spur your hearts, render your souls
Big men sacrifice your name for the cause
And lead us away from these shadows…
